# Patient Dictionary and TSH Diagnosis

### dictionary_and_diagnostic(filename)

This function takes a text file and determines all parameters in the assignment. For grading purposes, this is the most important function to import and text with a different text file!

The function retrieve_patient_info() is not explicitly used in the dictionary_and_diagnosis function. I made it largely for exploratory purposes.

I have also included documentation within the code for more information about what each function does. Sphinx documentation is also available in the index.html file!

Please ignore the json files folder, it is empty.

On GitHub, I have included the json files from the test_data.txt file. All are included for reference.
